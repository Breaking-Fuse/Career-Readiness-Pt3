A Unity practice problem

Given a 2D grid-based map, write a program that will find the shortest path and total movement cost to every valid and accessible location on the map for a single turn, starting at point X, using the following criteria:

<ul>
<li>You may move only North, East, South, or West, not diagonally.</li>
<li>Each move costs 1 movement point.</li>
<li>You have 6 movement points.</li>
<li>You may not move through or onto a shaded cell.</li>
</ul>
